// Provider allows us to add the reducer store that we created so we can manage state
// composeEnhancers allows us to use asyncronous code in our action creators.
// applyMiddleware needs to be passed into the composeEnhancers with the thunk argument which is the middleware i want to apply
// apply middleware is one kind of enhancer, dev tools is another. "Compose" allows us to apply this middleware
